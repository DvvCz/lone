# `lone`
My personal rewrite of Parallax's Solo editor.

I rewrote this to use a modern framework and codebase (svelte & typescript) and to make it much more minimal to achieve more or the same effect.

> As of June 2022, this project will not be actively developed considering I won't have access to a Parallax processor anymore since I've graduated. I will still try and keep it up to date and accept pull requests and issues.
